# Luke Morris Devlog for Project 2

# 12-2-2025 10:25 AM
## For this project I am tasked with creating a Prolog program that can solve a maze, which should always succeed if solving the maze is possible and fail otherwise. I plan to do some more practice with Prolog to become comfortable with its format, and I will do some research for constructs that may be useful for this assignment. I may write some pseudocode to determine what will be necessary to achieve this goal.
